> *The runes decide my path.* - Ryze, the Rune Mage

Greetings, Summoner!
RuneBook is ready to use and constantly updated. Please try the app and let me know what you think: any feedback is welcome!

# Download
You can find the [latest release here](https://github.com/OrangeNote/RuneBook/releases/latest).  
Download the Setup .exe (~50MB) if you're on *Windows*.  
Download the mac .zip (~60MB) file if you're on *macOS*.

# Features (and why it could be right for you)
The new Runes Reforged are great, but the overall experience isn't the best we could hope for. Yes, you can change runes while in champion select and that's great for customizing your playstyle, game by game, but you have a limited number of pages available. That means everytime you want to play a different champion you have to sacrifice one of your pages.  
\- *Well, it's ok, I can remake it afterwards.*  
But you aren't even able to remember the choices you made for your pages, and that's why you created a folder with screenshots ordered by champion that will help your memory: you will only have to copy the paths shown in figure when needed. Or you use online resources or guides if you don't even care about choices.

That sucks. That's an unnecessary waste of time (which is crucial in Champion Select by the way), and it's hard to manage your pages if you don't have a... Book.

**RuneBook features**:
- Local database for rune pages, organized by champion
- One-click import and export for pages, to/from the League Client
- Import pages from external sites, like champion.gg
- Bookmark online pages in the local section for a quicker access
- A nice and clean user interface
- One-click installation and automatic updates
- (technical) if JavaScript is your thing, know that RuneBook allows you to write modular plugins in order to extract rune pages from new external sources (documentation soon, see [existing plugins](https://github.com/OrangeNote/RuneBook/tree/master/plugins) for reference)

**Working on**:
- Generic pages that don't belong to a specific champion
- Auto select champion and favourite page when in champion select (that's what the heart button is for, but for now it does nothing)
